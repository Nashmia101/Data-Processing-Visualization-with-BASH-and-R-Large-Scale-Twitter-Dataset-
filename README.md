Data Processing & Visualization with BASH and R
Overview

This project focuses on working with large datasets using both the BASH Shell and R programming language. It highlights core skills in navigating the shell, processing compressed files, extracting and filtering data, and visualizing results in R. The dataset used is a large-scale collection of tweets related to COVID-19.

Objectives

BASH Shell: Navigate directories, process large files, extract and filter columns, and generate CSV outputs.

Data Wrangling: Use awk, grep, sort, uniq, and wc for scalable data analysis.

R Programming: Import processed CSV files, create bar plots, and compare retweet vs non-retweet engagement patterns.

Visualization: Communicate findings using comparative bar charts and interpret user engagement by follower ranges.

Tools & Techniques

BASH Commands: gunzip, awk, grep, sort, uniq, cut, wc

R (RStudio): Data import, bar charts, comparative analysis, exporting PNG visualizations

Data: ~1.1M rows of COVID-19 tweets
